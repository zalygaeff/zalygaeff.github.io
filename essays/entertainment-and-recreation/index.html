      <div class="mw8">
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Proper recreation, procrastination, and some entertainment are needed as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;a&nbsp;proper time management system in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;productive and fulfilled life and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;satisfied in&nbsp;general. Therefore, I&nbsp;have outlined a&nbsp;few principles for these activities too.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">First and foremost, there should be&nbsp;some time specifically dedicated to&nbsp;the rest. The time when work, pet-projects, education are not allowed at&nbsp;all. Ideally, no&nbsp;laptops or&nbsp;other gadgets involved either. I&nbsp;picked Sunday as&nbsp;the most appropriate day for&nbsp;me (as&nbsp;Saturday being used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;placeholder for all the things&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t managed during the workweek). This is&nbsp;the time for reading, going out for a&nbsp;walk, movies and stuff like that.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">In&nbsp;addition, I&nbsp;allow myself to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;sick leave when I&rsquo;m not in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good mood, or&nbsp;just feel like I&rsquo;m not productive today. Obviously, it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;an&nbsp;excuse just to&nbsp;skip work, yet&nbsp;I believe any conscious person is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;evaluate their state of&nbsp;mind and get a&nbsp;day off when appropriate. This isn&rsquo;t widely spread in&nbsp;our culture, however, it&nbsp;shouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp;perceived as&nbsp;something shameful. There&rsquo;s a&nbsp;simple need for a&nbsp;pause sometimes.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Obviously, when possible the best option is&nbsp;to&nbsp;change the environment, have a&nbsp;journey in&nbsp;other words. Judging from my&nbsp;past this is&nbsp;the most mind-blowing experience possible for recovery and recreation. Ironically, it&nbsp;works in&nbsp;the opposite direction as&nbsp;well: my&nbsp;trips to&nbsp;Asia, for instance, were the most insightful, rich from an&nbsp;ethnographic perspective, and personal growth. Somehow they made me&nbsp;a&nbsp;more confident person and a&nbsp;better professional. However, a&nbsp;trip itself shouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp;treated as&nbsp;something that takes a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;money, time or&nbsp;effort. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple walk within a&nbsp;district in&nbsp;your city you haven&rsquo;t explored yet. It&nbsp;works this way too.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Another principle&nbsp;I practice is&nbsp;combining a&nbsp;few activities together. Killing two birds with one stone, basically. So, for example, if&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;movie night I&rsquo;m going to&nbsp;invite some friends&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t seen for a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;join. Or&nbsp;I&nbsp;can take a&nbsp;walk around the block just to&nbsp;meditate on&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular thought. If&nbsp;it&rsquo;s reading, then it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;non-fiction which may somehow improve my&nbsp;life (sci-fi is&nbsp;used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sleeping pill only). When I&nbsp;play poker or&nbsp;chess&nbsp;I consider them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cognitive workout, not only as&nbsp;entertainment.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Finally, some hobbies may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful tool for recreation too. The one that works for me&nbsp;is&nbsp;music. I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;admit I&rsquo;m not quite successful there, yet somehow it&nbsp;gives me&nbsp;an&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;completely switch the focus and leave all the crap behind. It&nbsp;provides me&nbsp;some sort of&nbsp;a&nbsp;meditative state&nbsp;I would even say. There&rsquo;s nothing easier than launching a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;software and wearing headphones to&nbsp;leave distractions and worries behind.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb7">So, to&nbsp;sum&nbsp;up, recreation time shouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp;underrated as&nbsp;it&rsquo;s an&nbsp;integral part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fulfilled life. Yet, it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;different ways: sometimes all you need is&nbsp;to&nbsp;netflix and chill to&nbsp;procrastinate, and sometimes there&rsquo;s an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;get multiple benefits at&nbsp;once.</p>
