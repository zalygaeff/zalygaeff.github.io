      <h1 class="f1 lh-title mb1 mt0">On Time Management <span class="f5">0.1</span></h1>
      <div class="mw8">
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Since being introduced to the topic years and years ago I was trying to find the perfect solution which may fit my needs. I have tried a selection of well-known techniques like GTD or Pomodoro and dozen of less known methods during the last decade or so. Nothing worked that well.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">So, I came up to the conclusion that in case you want it to work good, just do it yourself then. My system has been developed through trial and error, a lot of them. Essentially, I have employed natural selection here. Some techniques come and go, some of them work well throughout the years. The system isn't set in stone, so regular build-measure-learn cycle works here as well.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb0">There are three principles I have defined that work in any case:</p>
        <ol class="pt0 mt0 mb4">
          <li class="lh-copy f4">
            <h2 class="mb0 mt2 f4">No long-term plans, but a vision</h2>
            <p class="mt0 mb2">Everything changes that fast, that there's no sense in making long-term plans (and yes, this is why new year resolutions are nonsense). Instead, it is better to have a vision regarding the following years and a general understanding of where you are heading. Then it is easy to break it down to work on a more granular level.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="lh-copy f4">
            <h2 class="mb0 mt0 f4">Limit yourself with closed lists &amp; time-boxing</h2>
            <p class="mt0 mb2">In order to achieve something and get things done, there should be a limit set: either with the number of plans or with the time frame. Otherwise, there's a good chance to get done none. The best case is to combine both types, obviously: quarterly planning, a limited quantity of action items daily, etc.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="lh-copy f4">
            <h2 class="mb0 mt0 f4">Everything should be logged</h2>
            <p class="mt0">In order to track the progress and to identify what works good, what's not it's a good idea to log down what was done. So, afterward, it's possible to analyze a particular period.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Getting back to the system itself. It is all built around the top-down approach. So, on the top I have a particular vision for the next few years, then it goes straight to quarter goals, and finally to weekly-daily tasks.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Basically, I figured out that a quarter or a season works perfectly as an increment. It's not that long, yet there's much time to do a lot. Another important technique for this level is the OKR concept: essentially, I have a number of objectives backed by measurable/trackable key results. This thing is mostly adopted by companies, but it turned out it may work for personal growth quite good as well. It all looks like a trivial mindmap, so I can do an overview of the progress in one place.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Also, there are additional helpers involved: kanban board and kaizen. Kanban concept basically can be boiled down to a bunch of cards attached somewhere next to your workplace to work as a reminder and show the actual progress. I have a board that shows me current priorities picked from quarter goals. The closed list concept is in place here is well – no more than 8 sheets allowed to narrow down the focus. The only difference from the canonical board is that every card is being in progress, so I don't use any unnecessary categorization.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Kaizen, on the other hand, is about continuous improvement over time, small steps each day for instance. Around one-third of my quarter activities is about it as it makes sense to do yoga every day or at least strive to it. I found it super useful for routines related to housekeeping and health.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">The final level is the weekly/daily breakdown. I was experimenting here a lot and figured out that weekly planning doesn't work for me. Mostly, I plan my activities for a day or a few days upfront. Also, recurrent events help here, so there's no need for rigorous planning. What actually matters are closed lists. A plain piece of paper is the best tool here: it has physical limitations, so you can't put everything in there; it's easy to interact with; there's nothing more satisfying than crossing out the completed items.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb7">So, to sum up: developing a system may take time, yet this is a natural process and it evolves over life. Moreover, I would say it is mandatory to experiment and adopt new techniques from different areas to make it stronger. Sticking to mainstream ideas may be a major pitfall as it limits an ability to find the best tools available.</p>
