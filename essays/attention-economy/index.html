      <h1 class="f1 lh-title mb1 mt0">The Attention Economy <span class="f5">0.1</span></h1>
      <div class="mw8">
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">At some point I figured out that something wrong is happening with me: continuous stress, anxiety, occasional symptoms of burnout (I don't actually believe in the concept itself thou) and overall understanding that I have lost control over my life. I became irritable, ill-humored and somewhat toxic. Definitely, not the person I would like to be, in other words.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">
          I started to analyze what were the reasons. Brief answer – office work. The expanded version: because of infinite multitasking, context switching and distractions I found myself in a situation of regular overworks, corrupted work-life balance (again, the thing I don't really believe in) and absolute loss of free time for self-reflection. Quite a trivial thing nowadays, actually.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">However, I'm not a person who seeks an easy answer for such complex issues. An obvious choice was to talk to a psychotherapist. Instead, I approached this with my regular design process. Got a problem? Let's dive into it and decompose what's happening there to come up with a better approach. Therefore, I have broken down the problem into five categories and came-up with different strategies to fix the whole situation.</p>

        <h2 class="f4 lh-title mb1 mt4">The health</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Quite an obvious one, as the source of personal energy it should be prioritized above all (however usually it is underestimated). The actual breakdown is pretty casual: proper diet, proper sleep, workouts, more time outside. The crapload of "best sellers" are written on the topic, so no need to stop here, it's no secret how to work on that. The only that matters is to do it. Just do it. First of all.</p>
        
        <h2 class="f4 lh-title mb1 mt4">Automation and time-saving</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">The next one is automation. Again, something that is not a secret ingredient, but rather something you have to remind yourself about from time to time. There is a good principle in the programming domain called DRY, which is "don't repeat yourself". It should be used as a starting point.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Need to top-up the mobile every month? Automate the payment. Apartment rent, any regular payments may be automated. Travel a lot? Create a travel checklist and get ready for any trip in 20 minutes. Shopping doesn't have to take an eternity. Here comes the time for the uniform concept. Everything else may be automated. Groceries may be delivered on a weekly basis, you just have to define your favorites. To sum up: surprisingly a lot of time may be saved by the usage of templates, checklists, and automation in general.</p>

        <h2 class="f4 lh-title mb1 mt4">Distractions elimination</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">The biggest issue here is definitely the office itself, as there's no secret that modern offices are not designed for productive work. It's being done somewhere else. The office nowadays is an interruption factory. The recipe is simple - get rid of the office. Go remote. No one cares about that actually, the only thing that matters is the result. Moreover, the work should be time-boxed and it doesn't have to live on your phone.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Other area for improvement here is the consumption of junk food information. The less is more. Social networks and modern click-bait journalism is optimized to hook you with the help of neuropsychology and behavioral economics, however, this is something you can easily live without. Dopamine may be produced in a different way. Do sport instead.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Last, not least. Notifications. Oh, notifications! Every freaking piece of software needs to send you a message. Starting from Apple harassing you with update prompts for your lovely gadgets, ending with advertising spam in messengers. The solution is simple – to disable them all or at least almost all. Also, it's a good idea to leave your gadgets somewhere where they are not easily accessible.</p>

        <h2 class="f4 lh-title mb1 mt4">Proper time-management system</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Any person has some sort of a system to deal with the avalanche of activities, which is good. Yet, it doesn't have to be perceived as something set in stone. Occasionally, it should be reviewed and improved.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">So, by evaluating my system I got back to closed lists which are opposite to what most of the productivity software provides. The idea is quite simple: your day doesn't have to be packed with an endless list of goals and todo's, it should be limited. By doing it that way you are able to stay focused on what really matters, more importantly, you get satisfaction when this list is completed. The feeling impossible to achieve with traditional methods like GTD, etc. </p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Another thing that worked for me is strictly timeboxed slots dedicated to one activity. Usually, it's around two or three hours of meaningful work in the flow state. Mostly, it is hard to allocate the time needed for that during business hours, but there's always a chance to minimize distractions.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Obviously, all communication should be somehow structured and limited. The preferable way here is asynchronous approach: emails, chats instead of conference calls and meetings. Meetings are toxic and are rarely efficient. The trick here is to ask yourself "Is my life too short for this one?". Of course, if the answer is yes, it should be skipped.</p>

        <h2 class="f4 lh-title mb1 mt4">Self-reflection</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">This is what I have underestimated in my life and once I changed the aproach everything shifted. There are two parts actually: somehow log what you've been doing and reflect on that.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Some sort of diary is always a good idea. It may be a gratitude journal (didn't work for me), it may be something more utilitarian (like a simple list of things done), up to you. The definition of format is somewhat iterational work.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb7">Another important thing here is to dedicate time to reflect on that. The concept of retreats is the way it worked for me: a separate day with no work, distractions and ideally with your phone in airplane mode. Once a month. Just a pure concentration on where you are, where are you heading, is this direction a right thing?</p>
