          Throughout the span of the last few years, I came to the concept of uniform. Basically, it's all about the definition of format and limitation of clothing you have. It allowed me to save time and attention needed to dress, save additional money, became more responsible in terms of consumption and, ironically, even became more fashionable.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">
          The definition of format was somehow easy for me since at some point I started to prefer black, grayish and white colors. Therefore, adopting the monochromatic scheme was the obvious choice. Limitation appeared through trial and error but ended up with a selection of Ukrainian and Japanese brands, most recently enhanced with LOT2046. Essentially, everything from this selection may be categorized as basic clothing.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">The main driver for me was the attention economy. It takes time to pick up the thing you like in a number of cases: either on a daily basis depending on the occasion or when you try to purchase something. Simply by defining brands I wear and color scheme prefer I was able to get rid of occasional mall scouting and endless web browsing. Also, it dramatically decreased the amount of clothing I have.
</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">The less important, yet a good reason to limit yourself was sustainable consumption. I can't say I'm totally into it as the whole thing is slightly overrated, but the idea of more meaningful utilization of stuff is something I do care about. After all the timeless design is what I always looking for. And, definitely quality is more significant for me than quantity.
</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb3">Not surprisingly, this approach is something well-known inside the fashion industry itself: the term "normcore" poped-up a few years ago and started the wave of anti-consumerism. Basic clothing became a manifesto. The discourse of ostentatious wealth has shifted.
