      <div class="mw8">
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">
          In the last five weeks I’ve travelled 7,000km overland through Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan’s GBAO region and China’s western provinces. After a year of working flat out the journey was part vacation, a desire to fill in few gaps of my knowledge of the region and a <a href="https://studiodradiodurans.com">Studio D</a> assignment.
        </p>
        <ul class="lh-copy f5">
          <li>If you want to understand how our planet will turn out this century, spend time in China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Brazil.</li>
          <li>If you’re wondering how long the Chinese economic miracle will last, the answer will probably be found in the bets made on commercial and residential developments in Chinese 3rd to 6th tier cities in Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai and Tibet.</li>
          <li>Touch ID doesn’t work at high altitude, finger prints are too dry.</li>
          <li>You no longer need to carry a translation app on your phone. If there’s someone to speak with, they’ll have one on theirs.</li>
          <li>A white male travelling alone in interesting places, will always need to disprove they are a spy. Thanks Hollywood.</li>
          <li>It is easier to deflect demands for a bribe when your paperwork is in order.</li>
          <li>The premium for buying gasoline in a remote village in the GBAO is 20% more than the nearest town. Gasoline is harder to come by, and more valuable than connectivity.</li>
          <li>Pretentious people are inherently less curious.</li>
          <li>Everything is fine, until that exact moment when it’s obviously not. It is easy to massively over/under estimate risk based on current contextual conditions. Historical data provides some perspective, but it usually comes down to your ability to read undercurrents, which in turn comes down to having built a sufficiently trusted relationship with people within those currents.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, everyone who says they know what is going on, is wrong.</li>
          <li>China is still arguably the lowest-trust consumer society in the world. If a product can be faked it will be. Out of necessity, they also have the most savvy consumers in the world.</li>
          <li>After twenty years of promising to deliver, Chinese solar products are now practical (available for purchase, affordable, sufficiently efficient, robust) for any community on the edge-of-grid, anywhere in the world. Either shared, or sole ownership.</li>
          <li>When a fixed price culture meets a negotiation culture, fun ensues.</li>
          <li>The sharing economy is alive and well, and has nothing to with your idea of the sharing economy.</li>
          <li>You can comfortably travel here for a month, on one month’s San Francisco rent.</li>
          <li>There is only one rule for a foreigner driving in the GBAO: give a lift to every local that wants one, until the car is full. It’s common to travel main thoroughfares for a day and only see a couple of vehicles.</li>
          <li>Every car in the GBAO should have at least one Russian speaker.</li>
          <li>There are are number of companies with a competitive smartphone portfolio. The rise of Oppo can be explained by its presence on every block of 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th tier Chinese cities.</li>
          <li>The most undervalued object on a long distance Chinese train journey is a power extension cable.</li>
          <li>People wearing fake Supreme are way more interesting than those that wear the real deal.</li>
          <li>Tibetan monks prefer iOS over Android.</li>
          <li>Eventually, anyone that values photos will carry a standalone camera.</li>
          <li>In order to size up the tribe/sub-tribe you’re part of, any group of young males will first look at the shoes on your feet.</li>
          <li>The sooner western companies own up to copying WeChat, the sooner we can get on with acknowledging a significant shift in the global creative center of gravity.</li>
          <li>Green tea beats black tea for acclimatising to altitude sickness.</li>
          <li>There is more certainty in reselling the past, than inventing the future.</li>
          <li>When you apply for a Chinese visa only say you’re visiting Shanghai. Never put Tibet/Xinjiang. You can enter through any port, and travel wherever you like when you get there.</li>
          <li>If you want to understand where a country is heading pick a 2nd or 3rd tier city and revisit it over many years. Chengdu remains my bellwether 2nd tier Chinese city. It’s inland, has a strong local identity and sub-cultures, and has room to grow.</li>

      <h1 class="mb1 f3"><a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html">Life is Short</a></h1>
      <div class="mw8">
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">It has for me. It means arguments of the form "Life is too short for x" have great force. It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for annoying. <span class="bg-light-yellow">If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.</span></p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There's something fake about it. It's the junk food of experience.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.</p>

</h1>
  		<div class="mw8">
  			<dl class="mt1">
  				<dt class="lh-copy f4 mb0">So why do you think Yakuza members like to be tattooed by you?</dt>
  				<dd>
  					<p class="lh-copy mt1">Yakuza always want the best; everything must be first class. Whatever they wear, the places they hang out, the women they walk with, and the cars they drive. They have a lot of pride. And they want to look good, so they come here.</p>
  					<p>...</p>
  				</dd>
  				<dt class="lh-copy f4">Why do you think it is important for tattoos to be hidden?</dt>
  				<dd>
  					<p class="lh-copy mt1">Tattoo culture in Japan is still a taboo, but that’s why the culture is beautiful. Fireflies can only be seen at night because their beauty is only visible at night. They aren't appreciated in daylight. When something becomes a fashion, it isn’t fascinating anymore. In Western culture, it might just be fashion or trendy, but in Japan, we appreciate tattoos you can’t see and that’s why we think they’re beautiful. Japanese culture is about being in the shadows.</p>
  					<p class="lh-copy">Western churches are bright and opulent but our temples are quite, dim, and dark. In Japanese culture, we depict the light by exploiting the shadows. The shadow of the buddhas are more important than the faces of sculptures. People get tattoos here knowing they won’t be showing them off all the time and that’s why we don’t take our tattoos lightly. Our spiritual culture is different from other countries because when we show our tattoos, it takes the form of a mysterious light that’s hidden and beautiful. That’s why it’s fascinating.

  		<div class="mw8">
  			<p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0">The system consists of one long list of everything that you have to do, written in a ruled notebook (25-35 lines to a page ideal). As you think of new items, add them to the end of the list. You work through the list one page at a time in the following manner:</p>
			<ol class="lh-copy f5">
			<li>Read quickly through all the items on the page without taking action on any of them.</li>
			<li>Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you.</li>
			<li>Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so</li>
			<li>Cross the item off the list, and re-enter it at the end of the list if you haven’t finished it</li>
			<li>Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don’t move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out</li>
			<li>Move onto the next page and repeat the process</li>
			<li>If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them. (N.B. This does not apply to the final page, on which you are still writing items). Use a highlighter to mark dismissed items.</li>
			<li>Once you’ve finished with the final page, re-start at the first page that is still active.</li>
