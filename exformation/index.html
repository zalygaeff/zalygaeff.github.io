      <div class="mw8">
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">It has for me. It means arguments of the form "Life is too short for x" have great force. It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for annoying. <span class="bg-light-yellow">If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.</span></p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There's something fake about it. It's the junk food of experience.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0 mb2">If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.</p>

  			<dl class="mt1">
  				<dt class="lh-copy f4 mb0">So why do you think Yakuza members like to be tattooed by you?</dt>
  				<dd>
  					<p class="lh-copy mt1">Yakuza always want the best; everything must be first class. Whatever they wear, the places they hang out, the women they walk with, and the cars they drive. They have a lot of pride. And they want to look good, so they come here.</p>
  					<p>...</p>
  				</dd>
  				<dt class="lh-copy f4">Why do you think it is important for tattoos to be hidden?</dt>
  				<dd>
  					<p class="lh-copy mt1">Tattoo culture in Japan is still a taboo, but that’s why the culture is beautiful. Fireflies can only be seen at night because their beauty is only visible at night. They aren't appreciated in daylight. When something becomes a fashion, it isn’t fascinating anymore. In Western culture, it might just be fashion or trendy, but in Japan, we appreciate tattoos you can’t see and that’s why we think they’re beautiful. Japanese culture is about being in the shadows.</p>
  					<p class="lh-copy">Western churches are bright and opulent but our temples are quite, dim, and dark. In Japanese culture, we depict the light by exploiting the shadows. The shadow of the buddhas are more important than the faces of sculptures. People get tattoos here knowing they won’t be showing them off all the time and that’s why we don’t take our tattoos lightly. Our spiritual culture is different from other countries because when we show our tattoos, it takes the form of a mysterious light that’s hidden and beautiful. That’s why it’s fascinating.

  		<div class="mw8">
  			<p class="lh-copy f4 pt0 mt0">The system consists of one long list of everything that you have to do, written in a ruled notebook (25-35 lines to a page ideal). As you think of new items, add them to the end of the list. You work through the list one page at a time in the following manner:</p>
			<ol class="lh-copy f5">
			<li>Read quickly through all the items on the page without taking action on any of them.</li>
			<li>Go through the page more slowly looking at the items in order until one stands out for you.</li>
			<li>Work on that item for as long as you feel like doing so</li>
			<li>Cross the item off the list, and re-enter it at the end of the list if you haven’t finished it</li>
			<li>Continue going round the same page in the same way. Don’t move onto the next page until you complete a pass of the page without any item standing out</li>
			<li>Move onto the next page and repeat the process</li>
			<li>If you go to a page and no item stands out for you on your first pass through it, then all the outstanding items on that page are dismissed without re-entering them. (N.B. This does not apply to the final page, on which you are still writing items). Use a highlighter to mark dismissed items.</li>
			<li>Once you’ve finished with the final page, re-start at the first page that is still active.</li>
